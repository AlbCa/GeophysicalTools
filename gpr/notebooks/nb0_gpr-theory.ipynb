    "# Tutorial: Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) — EM wave propagation and 2D FDTD modeling\n",

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) transmits short electromagnetic pulses and records the fields scattered and reflected by dielectric contrasts in the subsurface. Typical frequencies range from tens of MHz to a few GHz: higher frequency gives better resolution but less penetration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Raw data are usually displayed as radargrams (time vs horizontal position) or imaged using migration algorithms. The goal of GPR data processing is to transform noisy, uncorrected field data into a clean and interpretable subsurface image that accurately represents reflection geometry and depth.  \n",

    "## 3. Basic Processing Steps of a Raw GPR Radargram\n",
    "\n",
    "GPR data acquired in the field typically consists of raw traces recorded as the antenna moves along a profile. Each trace represents the amplitude of the reflected electromagnetic wave as a function of two-way travel time. Before interpretation, the raw radargram must undergo several processing steps to enhance signal quality, remove noise, and convert time into depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Time-Zero Correction\n",
    "Aligns the start of each trace so that the first arrival (direct wave) appears at time zero.  \n",
    "This compensates for small trigger delays and ensures consistent timing across traces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Dewow Filtering\n",
    "Removes low-frequency components caused by the instrument’s electronics or coupling effects.  \n",
    "A high-pass or running-average filter is typically applied to restore the signal’s oscillatory character.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Background Removal\n",
    "Subtracts the average trace or a low-rank component from the dataset to suppress horizontal banding and system ringing.  \n",
    "This enhances the visibility of localized reflections due to subsurface targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Gain Application\n",
    "Compensates for signal attenuation with depth by amplifying the later parts of each trace.  \n",
    "Common approaches include exponential, automatic gain control (AGC), or user-defined gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Bandpass Filtering\n",
    "Applies a frequency filter to retain only the useful frequency band of the antenna (e.g., 100–400 MHz for a 200 MHz antenna).  \n",
    "This step improves the signal-to-noise ratio and sharpens reflections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Migration\n",
    "Repositions dipping reflections and diffractions to their true subsurface locations.  \n",
    "Migration is essential for obtaining geometrically accurate images, especially in complex settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Time-to-Depth Conversion\n",
    "Converts the vertical axis from two-way travel time (ns) to depth (m) using an estimated/measured EM velocity or dielectric constant $\\varepsilon_r$. For a horizontally layered medium use the appropriate average (e.g., root-mean-square for layered media along the ray path). A rule-of-thumb for typical soils:\n",
