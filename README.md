## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions
To ensure reproducibility and modularity, three separate conda environments are used ‚Äî one for each main module.


### 1. Clone the repository
Open your terminal/Anaconda prompt and run this:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlbCa/GeophysicalTools.git
cd GeophysicalTools
```
### 2. Create the environments
The requirements are stored in the main folder (GeophysicalTools/) as `.yml` files, used to describe an environment ‚Äî that is, all the packages, dependencies, Python version, and sometimes even the channels (repositories) used to install them. 
Run the following commands to create the environments:
```bash
conda env create -f electro.yml
conda env create -f seismic.yml
conda env create -f gpr.yml
```
### 3. Activate the environment
Before running a notebook, activate the corresponding environment:  
```bash
conda activate electro    # for electro-magnetic methods
conda activate seismic    # for seismic methods
conda activate gpr        # for gpr
```
### 4. Launch Jupyter
Once the desired environment is active, start Jupyter:
```bash
jupyter lab
```
