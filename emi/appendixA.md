## Appendix A: Brief Review of the Maxwell Equations
from [Deidda et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15071772)

Electromagnetic induction phenomena obey `Maxwell’s equations`, which describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated by charges, currents, and changes of the fields.  
The differential form in the time domain of these equations is given by:

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{D} = q \quad \text{(Gauss’ law)} \tag{A1}
$$

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0 \quad \text{(Gauss’ law for magnetic fields)} \tag{A2}
$$

$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} \quad \text{(Faraday’s law)} \tag{A3}
$$

$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{H} = \mathbf{J} + \frac{\partial \mathbf{D}}{\partial t} \quad \text{(Ampère–Maxwell’s law)} \tag{A4}
$$

where:  
- **D** is the dielectric displacement (C/m²)  
- **B** is the magnetic flux density or magnetic induction (T)  
- **E** is the electric field intensity (V/m)  
- **H** is the magnetic field intensity (A/m)  
- **J** is the electric current density (A/m²)  
- **q** is the electric charge density (C/m³)  

The symbols ∇· and ∇× denote the `divergence` and `curl` operators, respectively.


These equations are coupled through the following `constitutive relations`:

$$
\mathbf{D} = \varepsilon \mathbf{E} \tag{A5}
$$

$$
\mathbf{B} = \mu \mathbf{H} \tag{A6}
$$

$$
\mathbf{J} = \sigma \mathbf{E} \tag{A7}
$$

where:
- $ \varepsilon $ is the dielectric permittivity (F/m)  
- $ \mu $ is the magnetic permeability (H/m)  
- $ \sigma $ is the electric conductivity (S/m)  

In free space ($\sigma = 0 $), the dielectric permittivity and the magnetic permeability take the values:

$$
\varepsilon_0 = 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F/m}, \qquad
\mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \, \text{H/m}.
$$

For any medium other than a vacuum, the ratio of the permeabilities of a medium to that of free space
defines the dimensionless  relative parameters:

$$
\mu_r = \frac{\mu}{\mu_0}, \qquad
\varepsilon_r = \frac{\varepsilon}{\varepsilon_0}.
$$

### Magnetic Susceptibility and Magnetization

For a magnetic material, Equation (A6) can be expressed using the `magnetic susceptibility` $ \chi $, which measures how much a material is susceptible to being magnetized:

$$
\chi = \mu_r - 1 \tag{A8}
$$

Thus, the magnetic permeability becomes:

$$
\mu = \mu_0 + \mu_0 \chi \tag{A9}
$$

Hence, the magnetic induction field **B** can be expressed as:

$$
\mathbf{B} = \mu \mathbf{H} = \mu_0(1 + \chi)\mathbf{H}
= \mu_0 \mathbf{H} + \mu_0 \chi \mathbf{H}
= \mu_0 \mathbf{H} + \mu_0 \mathbf{M} \tag{A10}
$$

where:

$$
\mathbf{M} = \chi \mathbf{H} \tag{A11}
$$

is the `magnetization field` that the material acquires when a magnetic field **H** acts on it.

### Electromagnetic Wave Equations

Maxwell’s equations together with the constitutive relations can be combined to yield the `electromagnetic wave equations` for propagation (as wave and diffusion) of electric and magnetic fields in an isotropic homogeneous lossy medium having electric conductivity $\sigma $, magnetic permeability $ \mu $, and dielectric permittivity $ \varepsilon $.

Taking the curl of Equation (A3) and using, in order, Equations (A6), (A4), (A7), and (A5), together with the identity 
$ \nabla \times (\nabla \times \mathbf{E}) = -\nabla^2 \mathbf{E} $, where the symbol $\nabla^2$ stands for the `Laplacian` operator, gives the `electric field equation` in time domain:

$$
\nabla^2 \mathbf{E} - \mu \sigma \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}
- \mu \varepsilon \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2} = 0 \tag{A12}
$$

Likewise, taking the curl of Equation (A4) and following a similar process yields the `magnetic field equation` in time domain:

$$
\nabla^2 \mathbf{H} - \mu \sigma \frac{\partial \mathbf{H}}{\partial t}
- \mu \varepsilon \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{H}}{\partial t^2} = 0 \tag{A13}
$$


### Harmonic Fields and Helmholtz Equations

For harmonically varying fields at angular frequency $ \omega $, that is

$$
\mathbf{E} = \mathbf{E}_0 e^{-i \omega t}, \qquad
\mathbf{H} = \mathbf{H}_0 e^{-i \omega t},
$$

Equations (A12) and (A13) become the `Helmholtz equations`:

$$
\nabla^2 \mathbf{E} + i\omega\mu\sigma\mathbf{E}
+ \omega^2 \mu \varepsilon \mathbf{E}
= \nabla^2 \mathbf{E} + k^2 \mathbf{E} = 0 \tag{A14}
$$

$$
\nabla^2 \mathbf{H} + i\omega\mu\sigma\mathbf{H}
+ \omega^2 \mu \varepsilon \mathbf{H}
= \nabla^2 \mathbf{H} + k^2 \mathbf{H} = 0 \tag{A15}
$$

where the `complex wavenumber` is:

$$
k = \sqrt{\omega^2 \mu \varepsilon + i \omega \mu \sigma}
= a + ib \tag{A16}
$$

whose real and imaginary parts given by (Ward et al., 1987):

$$
a = \omega \sqrt{\frac{\mu \varepsilon}{2}
\left( \sqrt{1 + \frac{\sigma^2}{\omega^2 \varepsilon^2}} + 1 \right)} \tag{A17}
$$

$$
b = \omega \sqrt{\frac{\mu \varepsilon}{2}
\left( \sqrt{1 + \frac{\sigma^2}{\omega^2 \varepsilon^2}} - 1 \right)} \tag{A18}
$$

The imaginary part $ b $, also called the `attenuation coefficient`, plays a key role in electromagnetism since its inverse defines the `skin depth` $ \delta $.


## Appendix A.1: Quasi-Stationary Approximation

Alternating electromagnetic fields that vary slowly with time are referred to as `low-frequency alternating fields` or `quasi-stationary fields`. In the quasi-stationary case, Maxwell’s equations can be simplified by neglecting the term 
$ \frac{\partial \mathbf{D}}{\partial t} $ in Ampère–Maxwell’s law (A4), 
but retaining the term $ \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} $ in Faraday’s law (A3).   
This means that the `displacement current is negligible` with respect to the `conduction current`, which remains the only source of the quasi-stationary magnetic field.  
This also means that the electromagnetic properties of the medium are such that
$
\sigma \gg \omega \varepsilon.
$
Then, the equations (A14) and (A15) simplify to:

$$
\nabla^2 \mathbf{E} + i\omega\mu\sigma \mathbf{E} \approx 0 \tag{A19}
$$

$$
\nabla^2 \mathbf{H} + i\omega\mu\sigma \mathbf{H} \approx 0 \tag{A20}
$$

These are known as the `diffusion equations of electromagnetic fields`, describing the penetration of electromagnetic fields (do not consider wave propagation!) in an isotropic homogeneous lossy medium.

The complex wavenumber becomes:

$$
k = \sqrt{i\omega\mu\sigma} = a + ib \tag{A21}
$$

with:

$$
a = b = \sqrt{|k^2|} = \sqrt{\frac{\omega \mu \sigma}{2}} = \frac{1}{\delta'} \tag{A22}
$$

where the `skin depth` is defined as:

$$
\delta = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\omega \mu \sigma}} \tag{A23}
$$
